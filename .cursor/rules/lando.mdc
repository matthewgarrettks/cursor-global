# Lando Development Environment

## Setup and Configuration

- When working on a project with `.lando.yml`, ensure Lando is running (`lando start` or `lando rebuild`)
- Always configure a permanent database port in `.lando.local.yml` at the project root:
```yaml
services:
  database:
    portforward: 60727
```
  Use a unique port number that doesn't conflict with other services
- `.lando.local.yml` files are always ignored in `.gitignore`
- If `.lando.yml` or `.lando.local.yml` changes, rebuild with `lando rebuild -y`

## Testing and Data

- Use the Lando website for testing: `<name>.lndo.site` (where `<name>` is from `.lando.yml`)
- All data on the Lando webserver is non-production - safe to run any tests including inserts/deletes

## Synchronization

- When asked to sync/get latest **data**: Run `lando syncdb` from project root, accepting all prompts
- When asked to sync/get latest **files** or **uploads**: Run `lando syncuploads` from project root, accepting all prompts
- Ensure tooling exists for running lando syncdb (db sync from prod server) and lando syncuploads (file sync from prod server)
- **Always do syncs one at a time** - never run both database and file syncs simultaneously
