- Strive to meet WCAG 2.2 AA standards
- Don't use `accessKey` attribute on any HTML element.
- Don't set `aria-hidden="true"` on focusable elements.
- Don't add ARIA roles, states, and properties to elements that don't support them.
- Don't use distracting elements like `<marquee>` or `<blink>`.
- Only use the `scope` prop on `<th>` elements.
- Don't assign non-interactive ARIA roles to interactive HTML elements.
- Make sure label elements have text content and are associated with an input.
- Don't assign interactive ARIA roles to non-interactive HTML elements.
- Don't assign `tabIndex` to non-interactive HTML elements.
- Don't use positive integers for `tabIndex` property.
- Don't include "image", "picture", or "photo" in img alt prop.
- Don't use explicit role property that's the same as the implicit/default role.
- Make static elements with click handlers use a valid role attribute.
- Always include a `title` element for SVG elements.
- Give all elements requiring alt text meaningful information for screen readers.
- Make sure anchors have content that's accessible to screen readers.
- Assign `tabIndex` to non-interactive HTML elements with `aria-activedescendant`.

- Make sure ARIA properties are valid for the element's supported roles.
- Always include a `type` attribute for button elements.

- Accompany `onClick` with at least one of: `onKeyUp`, `onKeyDown`, or `onKeyPress`.
- Accompany `onMouseOver`/`onMouseOut` with `onFocus`/`onBlur`.
