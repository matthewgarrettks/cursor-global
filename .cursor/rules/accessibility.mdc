# Accessibility Rules - WCAG 2.2 AA Standards

Strive to meet WCAG 2.2 AA standards in all code. Focus on making content perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.

## Perceivable

### Text Alternatives
- Provide meaningful `alt` text for all images. Describe the image's purpose, not that it's an image.
- Include `<title>` elements for SVG graphics that convey information.
- Use `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` for icons and decorative elements that need context.

### Time-based Media
- Include captions/subtitles for all video content.
- Provide transcripts for audio content.
- Include descriptive text for audio/video controls.

### Distinguishable
- Ensure sufficient color contrast (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information.
- Ensure interactive elements have visible focus indicators.

## Operable

### Keyboard Accessibility
- All interactive functionality must be keyboard accessible.
- Use semantic HTML elements (`<button>`, `<a>`, `<input>`) instead of divs/spans with click handlers.
- If using non-semantic elements for interaction, add appropriate ARIA roles and make them keyboard focusable.
- Never use positive `tabIndex` values. Use `tabIndex={0}` only when necessary for focus management.
- Ensure logical tab order matches visual order.

### Focus Management
- Interactive elements must be focusable.
- Don't set `aria-hidden="true"` on focusable elements.
- Provide visible focus indicators for all interactive elements.
- When using `onClick`, also provide keyboard handlers (`onKeyDown` or `onKeyPress` with Enter/Space).

### Navigation
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`).
- Use proper heading hierarchy (`<h1>` through `<h6>`) without skipping levels.
- Provide skip links for main content areas.
- Use ARIA landmarks when semantic HTML isn't sufficient.

### Input Modalities
- Ensure touch targets are at least 44x44 CSS pixels.
- Don't require specific gestures (pinch, swipe) for essential functionality.

## Understandable

### Readable
- Always include `lang` attribute on `<html>` element with valid ISO language code.
- Use clear, simple language appropriate for the content.

### Predictable
- Ensure consistent navigation and functionality across pages.
- Don't change context unexpectedly (e.g., auto-submit on selection).
- Provide clear labels for all form inputs using `<label>` elements properly associated with inputs.

### Input Assistance
- Provide clear error messages that identify the field and describe the error.
- Use `aria-describedby` to associate error messages with form fields.
- Use appropriate `autocomplete` attributes on form inputs.
- For authentication, don't rely solely on cognitive function tests (CAPTCHAs should have alternatives).

## Robust

### Semantic HTML
- Prefer semantic HTML elements over ARIA when possible.
- Use correct HTML elements for their intended purpose (`<button>` for buttons, `<a>` for links).
- Don't use deprecated or distracting elements (`<marquee>`, `<blink>`).

### ARIA Usage
- Only use ARIA when semantic HTML isn't sufficient.
- Don't override native semantics with ARIA (e.g., don't add `role="button"` to a `<button>`).
- Ensure all ARIA attributes are valid and appropriate for the element.
- Include all required ARIA attributes when using ARIA roles.
- Ensure ARIA properties are valid for the element's supported roles.

### Form Elements
- Always include `type` attribute on button elements.
- Associate labels with inputs using `for`/`id` or by wrapping input in label.
- Use appropriate input types (`email`, `tel`, `url`, etc.) for better mobile keyboards and validation.

### Interactive Elements
- Ensure all anchors have accessible text content (not just icons or images).
- Make sure clickable elements have accessible names (text content, `aria-label`, or `aria-labelledby`).
- Include `title` attribute for iframe elements describing their purpose.
