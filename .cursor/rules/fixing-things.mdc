# Fixing Issues - Self-Testing Requirements

When asked to fix an issue, **you must test the fix yourself** before reporting it as fixed. Do not ask the user to test or verify the fix.

## Testing Requirements

1. **Test the exact scenario** that was presented whenever possible
   - Reproduce the original issue/problem
   - Verify the fix resolves the specific issue
   - Test edge cases related to the fix

2. **Use all available tools** to test the fix:
   - **Local development servers**: Docker, Lando (start if necessary)
   - **Browser tools**: Chrome DevTools, browser automation, accessibility tools
   - **Testing frameworks**: Unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests
   - **Command line tools**: Linters, validators, build tools
   - **API testing**: curl, Postman, or framework-specific testing tools
   - **Database tools**: Query validators, migration testers
   - Any other relevant tools available in the environment

3. **Iterate until fixed**:
   - If a test fails, diagnose the issue and fix it
   - Re-test after each fix attempt
   - Continue this cycle until the fix is verified working
   - Only report the issue as fixed after successful verification

4. **Report results**:
   - Clearly state what was tested and how
   - Confirm the fix is working before marking as complete
   - If testing reveals additional issues, address them as well
