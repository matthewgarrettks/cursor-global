# Task List Management

## File Location and Naming

- Create task lists in `.cursor/tasks/` directory (or project root)
- Use `TASKS.md` or descriptive feature name (e.g., `ASSISTANT_CHAT.md`)

## Task List Structure

```markdown
# Feature Name Implementation

Brief description of the feature and its purpose.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Task 1 completed
- [x] Task 2 completed

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Task 3 - currently working on
- [ ] Task 4 (P1) - high priority, blocked by Task 3

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Task 5 - planned for later
- [ ] Task 6 (depends on: Task 4) - requires Task 4 first

## Blocked Tasks

- [ ] Task 7 - waiting on external dependency

## Notes

- Architecture decision: Using X pattern because Y
- Important: Remember to update config when deploying

## Relevant Files

- `path/to/file1.ts` - Description ✅
- `path/to/file2.ts` - Description
- `path/to/file3.ts` - Description (WIP)
```

## Task Formatting

- Use priority indicators: `(P1)` high, `(P2)` medium, `(P3)` low
- Note dependencies: `(depends on: Task X)`
- Mark blockers: `(blocked by: Task X)` or move to "Blocked Tasks"
- Link to issues/PRs: `[#123](link)` or `(see PR #456)`

## Maintenance Guidelines

- Mark completed tasks with `[x]` and move to "Completed Tasks"
- Update "Relevant Files" with file paths and status (✅ complete, WIP, etc.)
- Document architecture decisions and important notes
- Add new tasks as discovered during implementation
- Remove completed tasks from "In Progress" immediately after completion

## AI Instructions

- Update task list after implementing significant components
- Check task list before starting work to identify next task
- Mark tasks complete and move them immediately
- Document decisions, blockers, and dependencies
- Keep "Relevant Files" section current with accurate paths and status
